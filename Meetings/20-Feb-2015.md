Meeting Minutes
==

We divided us in 2 teams, one would be handling the frontend and other would be dealing with the backend. Hopefully both will merge and the project will reach to completion at a much faster pace. 

Frontend
==
* Akanshi and Divjot will firstly find the right MV* framework to use (from todomvc.com)
* They'll start developing the GUI and in a week's time we'll know how our App would finally look like (with dummy content).
* Then as and when the API is made by Backend, it'll be integrated to frontend. 

Backend
==
* Ayush and Chitrasoma will familiarize themselves with MongoDB on PHP by creating a simple Database with 2 collections (users and colleges) and do some queries on it, just for fun :)
* They'll then begin with the API and all the other things. 
* Initially Models will be made with all the neat and clean functions, like Create Retrieve Update and Delete. 
* Then Controllers will be made using the models, to create complex features like say "List of Students of NSIT who attended PG at MIT" (not so complex in Mongo).
* Slim Framework (slimframework.com) shall be used for routing in the final stage.
